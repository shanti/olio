2011-July Olio Incubator status report

Olio is a web 2.0 toolkit to help developers evaluate the suitability, 
functionality and performance of various web technologies by implementing 
a reasonably complex application in several different technologies.

There is not much activity on this project. No major user requests have been
received.

Graduation From Incubation:

The user base is not showing growth. Since this is a test application/workload, 
it is being used as such for short-term projects.
As such, we need to decide how to handle this project. It is still useful as is.
