2009-April Olio Incubator status report

Olio has been incubating since September 2008.

Olio is a web 2.0 toolkit to help developers evaluate the suitability, 
functionality and performance of various web technologies by implementing 
a reasonably complex application in several different technologies.

. Olio is continuing to gain users and being used for diverse purposes.
  - One user is using it for testing MySQL performance.
  - Another is using it for testing performance of file systems.
. Microsoft has started a .NET port of Olio.
. VMWare has joined the project and plans to use it for several of their 
  performance testing efforts.
. There are multiple deployments attempting to scale Olio to test performance
of system infrastructure, software application stack etc.
. A lot of work has gone to make the product more robust and stable over
  long benchmark runs - over 50 JIRA issues have been fixed.
. Work is underway to create the first release. The artificats are tested; the
  major work is in fixing the source headers, licenses etc.

. Olio has been presented to some Apache and Rails Meetups to get attention.
. We're encouraging users to become active in contributing to the code.
