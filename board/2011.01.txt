2011-January Olio Incubator status report

Olio has been incubating since September 2008.

Olio is a web 2.0 toolkit to help developers evaluate the suitability, 
functionality and performance of various web technologies by implementing 
a reasonably complex application in several different technologies.

Things have been fairly quiet on both the user and developer list this quarter.

Graduation From Incubation:

The user base is not showing growth. Since this is a test application/workload, 
it is being used as such for short-term projects.
