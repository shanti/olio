2009-April Olio Incubator status report

Olio has been incubating since September 2008.

Olio is a web 2.0 toolkit to help developers evaluate the suitability, 
functionality and performance of various web technologies by implementing 
a reasonably complex application in several different technologies.

Olio voted a new committer, Amanda Waite.

Olio made its first release, Olio-0.1. Being a complex piece of software
with many third party dependencies and multiple languages, this was 
a major task.

Olio is continuing to gain users and being used for diverse purposes.
There are 28 subscribers to the user list and 26 subscribers to dev.
There are over a hundred JIRA issues filed, and continuous activity
toward closing them.

The Java implementation for Olio has been checked into the repository,
joining the Rails and Php implementations.

Graduation From Incubation:

Diversity of committers is the primary issue with the project, with
all of the active developers coming from three organizations.
