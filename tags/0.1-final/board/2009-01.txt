Olio has been incubating since September 2008.

Olio is a web 2.0 toolkit to help developers evaluate the suitability, 
functionality and performance of various web technologies by implementing 
a reasonably complex application in several different technologies.

. Olio is now being run actively by several organizations.

. There are multiple deployments attempting to scale Olio to test performance
of system infrastructure, software application stack etc.
